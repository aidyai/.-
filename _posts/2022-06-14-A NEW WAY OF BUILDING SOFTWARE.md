A new way of writing program and building software is upon us, its very different from the traditional way programmers have been building software. This article focuses strictly on explaining this new technique of building software.

……….. ## We have to understand that a Software is a bundle of hard or soft coded algorithmic steps that performs a particular task ## ..…..

This technique have been around for over 100 years now but it has recently gotten traction as a result of the availability of various sister components which we will talk about later as we progress.

This new way of building software ** according to recent valuation reports is a 100 Trillion Dollar Industry**, It is the brain behind autonomous vehicles, the excellent search results you get from search engines,  Disease Classifiers, Facial Recognition Systems, Chatbots,  Protein discovery, Language Translation, and lots more etc. It is affecting Industry upon Industry in ways we couldn’t imagine possible.

## WHAT THE HECK IS THIS NEW TECHNIQUE?

If you haven’t been living in the cave these past decades, you have probably heard of  buzzwords like Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Deep Learning on the news, in movies or maybe from Elon Musk lol.

Artificial Intelligence is just a branch of computer science, which has Machine Learning as its branch and Deep Learning as a sub-branch. I will not define Artificial Intelligence due to some reasons but I will define Machine Learning and dwell on it because it is the mastermind behind this new way of building software.

This technique I will term as machine learning programming

### **MACHINE LEARNING: …………………………………………….**

1. This yields powerful insights that can be used to predict future outcomes.

## THE NATURE OF MACHINE LEARNING PROGRAMMING

1. Firstly, data powers this kind of software meaning in order to build software with this technique, data is provided as well as the expected output to the Algorithm which will then generate the program(**model**). In more details, **Machine Learning** programming requires feeding an input data and output data into an Algorithm to create a program. 
2.  The kind of Data the Algorithm ingests could take the form of Images, Audio, Text, Tabular, videos etc and consequently the algorithm learns, in a very real sense, to recognize patterns in any of the above data types ingested into it.
3. In machine learning programming, the instructions, logic or rules is learnt and written by the Machine Learning algorithm based on the underlying data it takes as input meaning we are not hard-coding the logic or the rules. 
4. Building software with machine learning programming involves 3 Phases:
    
    ~~There are various methods that are introduced to bring out the best from this algorithms during the 3 phases~~
    
    > **~~Data Splitting: Since we all agree that software is built to perform specific task and they all work with data, machine learning programming is not any different from this too in that it is built to solve a particular problem and works with data (the larger the data the better the performance). data splitting in machine learning programming means partitioning data for training(80%) and testing(20%).~~**
    > 
    
    **a.** The first phase in this new technique of programming is referred to as **training**, this consists of feeding training data and the expected outcome for each data example to the ML Algorithm that is suited. The training phase is when our algorithm starts gaining knowledge of a particular task it is to perform, it is an iterative phase that involves the algorithm going back and forth, trying to correct itself thus achieving the very best of performance given that dataset. [The way the algorithm works during training is explained here in details](https://medium.com/@aidyosu553/how). 
    
    **b.** How is do we evaluate the performance of our trained model?. This is when we perform testing. Testing is basically exposing our program (trained model) on test data (holdout data for testing) it didn’t see during training to test its accuracy which is a score that indicates its ability to perform that given task.
    
5. In machine learning programming, the accurate performance of our program is directly proportional to the usage because it makes it gets better and better.
6. In machine learning programming, the primary goal is to optimize the metric (accuracy, precision/recall, RMSE, etc) of the models. Every 0.1 % improvement in the model metrics could result in significant business value creation. The quality of the model depends upon various parameters which are mainly related to the input data and hyperparameters tuning.
7. These machine learning programs are created using different algorithms and associated libraries and frameworks. 
8. MLOPS ASPECT: After the model is created, it is deployed to production and “inference” refers to using the model to make predictions in real usage scenarios. Note that deployment of ML models to production is a complex topic by itself and there is an emerging field called ML Ops or AI Ops.

## STEPS IN BUILDING A MACHINE LEARNING MODEL

1. DATA COLLECTION AND GATHERING: The quality of Data you gather determines how good the model will perform or can be
2. DATA PREPARATION: Load the data into a suitable place and prepare it for use ;; prepreocessing analyzing the level of bias within such dataset, spliting that data into parts train, val, test, cleaning, normalization, creating extra features,
3. Choosing An ALgorithm: There are many models that researchser and Data Scientist hae created arbitrarily suited for different dtat types: Sequence Data (e.g Music, Text), Image Data, Tabular Data, 
4. TRAINING AND VALIDATION PHASE: Similar to learning to drive a Car, 
5. TESTING: TEST ON A HELD OUT SET; That will determine its performance in real world settings
6. HYPER-PARAMETER TUNING: tuning parameters e.g learning rates, batch size
7. PREDICTION

## CONCLUSION

A new era of programming is upon us and the field is one in many that have efficiently delivered on the hype as we have all seen. All we need do is define a certain business task or problem we need to optimize that relies on Data (**”it must involve data”**) then we find a suitable algorithm let the algorithm write the logic, then we have a program. The field of Machine learning is not slowing down and it may never slow down any time soon as such we will see tremendous mind-blowing solutions as the years roll on.
